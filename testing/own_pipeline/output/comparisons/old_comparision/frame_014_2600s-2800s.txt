FRAME 14: 2600s to 2800s
================================================================================

Okay, I've analyzed the two sets of aligned audio segments for the time frame between 2600s and 2800s. Here's a breakdown of the key differences, potential reasons for these differences, and patterns observed:

**1. Overall Comparison:**

*   **Version 1:** Generally better alignment to the provided `human_text` within the specified 2600-2800 second time frame. CER values are lower on average, indicating higher transcription accuracy and better alignment.
*   **Version 2:** Exhibits significant misalignments, particularly between 2613s and 2703s. The ASR text in these segments does not correspond well to the provided `human_text`, resulting in very high CER values. It appears to be aligning to speech from a different part of the audio.

**2. Detailed Analysis of Differences:**

*   **Segment Boundaries:**
    *   Version 1 has consistent 20-second segments, except for the segment at 2691.94440625, which is shorter (10.56 seconds).
    *   Version 2 has variable segment lengths. It introduces shorter segments (e.g., 2613.01596875-2617.22534375 and 2743.06846875-2746.11659375).
    *   The start times are slightly different between the two versions, indicating a change in the alignment process itself.

*   **CER Values:**
    *   Version 1 has CER values ranging from 0.0 to 0.27, with most segments having CER values below 0.25.
    *   Version 2 has CER values ranging from 0.14 to 0.75. Segments between 2613s and 2703s have extremely high CER values (0.44 to 0.75), indicating major alignment issues.

*   **Text Alignment:**
    *   **Version 1:** The ASR text generally aligns well with the human text within each segment. There are some transcription errors, but the overall meaning is preserved.
    *   **Version 2:** The ASR text in several segments is completely different from the human text. For example, the segment from 2617.22534375 to 2637.22534375 in Version 2 has ASR text that seems to belong to a completely different part of the audio.

*   **Speaker Changes:**
    *   Both versions appear to handle speaker changes within segments reasonably well when the alignment is accurate. However, the misalignment in Version 2 makes it difficult to assess how speaker changes are handled in those specific segments.
    *   The segment at 2695.55909375 in Version 2 seems to be an attempt to align to a speaker change ("Der Kollege Dr. Hocker hat eine Nachfrage."). Version 1 aligns the previous speaker's text up to 2702.5064375.

*   **Systematic Patterns:**
    *   Version 2 has a clear pattern of misalignment between 2613s and 2703s. This suggests a potential issue with the alignment algorithm in this specific time frame, possibly due to audio quality issues, speaker overlap, or other factors that confuse the alignment process.

**3. Potential Reasons for Differences in Performance:**

*   **ASR Model Changes:** The underlying ASR model might have been updated between the two versions. This could lead to different transcription outputs, which in turn affect the alignment.
*   **Alignment Algorithm Changes:** The alignment algorithm itself might have been modified. This could explain the differences in segment boundaries and the overall alignment quality.
*   **Audio Quality Variations:** The audio quality might vary across the recording. If the audio quality is poor in certain segments, the ASR model might produce inaccurate transcriptions, leading to misalignment.
*   **Speaker Overlap/Crosstalk:** Sections with speaker overlap or crosstalk can confuse the ASR and alignment systems, leading to errors.
*   **Data Used for Training:** The models may have been trained on different data, causing one model to perform better on this specific audio.

**4. Specific Examples:**

*   **Example 1 (Misalignment):**
    *   **Version 1 (2611.94 - 2631.94):** `asr_text` and `human_text` are well-aligned with a CER of 0.09.
    *   **Version 2 (2617.22 - 2637.22):** `asr_text` and `human_text` are completely misaligned, with a CER of 0.75. The ASR text in Version 2 seems to be from a different part of the audio.
*   **Example 2 (Segment Boundary):**
    *   Version 1 keeps a single segment from 2591.94440625 to 2611.94440625
    *   Version 2 splits this into two segments at 2593.01596875 to 2613.01596875 and 2613.01596875 to 2617.22534375.

**5. Conclusion:**

Version 1 demonstrates superior alignment quality and transcription accuracy compared to Version 2 within the analyzed time frame. Version 2 suffers from significant misalignments, particularly between 2613s and 2703s. The changes in segment boundaries and the high CER values in Version 2 suggest that the alignment algorithm or the ASR model might have been modified in a way that negatively impacts performance on this specific audio segment. Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause of these issues and to identify potential solutions. It would be beneficial to examine the audio in the misaligned sections to check for audio quality issues or speaker overlap.
