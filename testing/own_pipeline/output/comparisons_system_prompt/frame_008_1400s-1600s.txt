FRAME 8: 1400s to 1600s
================================================================================

Okay, let's dive into a comparison of the two alignment versions for the audio segment spanning 1400s to 1600s.

**Overall Observations:**

*   **Segmentation Differences:** Version 2 exhibits more fragmented segmentation, particularly noticeable around the 1500-1600 second mark. Version 1 tends to have longer, more consistent 20-second segments (where possible), while Version 2 has segments of varying lengths, including some very short ones.
*   **CER Variations:** While some segments show similar CER values, there are instances where one version significantly outperforms the other. This suggests differences in how the ASR output is aligned to the reference transcript.
*   **Shifted Start Times:** The start times of segments are different between the two versions. Version 2 seems to start later in the audio.
*   **Speaker Change/Boundary Issues:** The fragmentation in Version 2 around the 1590s mark seems to coincide with a speaker change or a transition to a different part of the audio, indicating a potential weakness in handling such boundaries.
*   **ASR Text Differences:** There are some differences in the ASR text between the two versions, which could be due to different ASR models or different decoding parameters.

**Detailed Analysis with Examples:**

1.  **Segment Boundaries and Fragmentation:**

    *   **Version 1:** The first segment starts at 1390.423 and ends at 1410.423.
    *   **Version 2:** The first segment starts at 1399.47471875 and ends at 1419.47471875.
        *   **Analysis:** Version 2's first segment starts almost 10 seconds later than Version 1. This could be due to a different voice activity detection (VAD) threshold or a different approach to determining the start of speech.
    *   **Version 1:** Has one segment from 1504.193 to 1514.571671875.
    *   **Version 2:** Has two segments from 1504.66971875 to 1511.64284375 and from 1511.64284375 to 1513.83659375.
        *   **Analysis:** Version 2 splits this section into two segments, with the second segment being very short and having a high CER. This suggests that the ASR system in Version 2 is having trouble with this part of the audio.
    *   **Version 1:** Has one segment from 1589.75503125 to 1609.75503125.
    *   **Version 2:** Has three segments from 1590.45534375 to 1592.40659375, from 1592.40659375 to 1599.47721875, and from 1599.47721875 to 1619.47721875.
        *   **Analysis:** Version 2 splits this section into three segments, with the first two segments having high CERs. This suggests that the ASR system in Version 2 is having trouble with this part of the audio, possibly due to a speaker change or background noise.

2.  **CER Differences:**

    *   **Segment around 1430s-1440s:** Version 1 has a CER of 0.202020202, while Version 2 has a CER of 0.5 for the segment around 1439.47471875 to 1445.47596875.
        *   **Analysis:** The higher CER in Version 2 suggests that the ASR output is less accurate or the alignment is worse in this segment.
    *   **Segment around 1464s-1484s:** Version 1 has a CER of 0.2072072072, while Version 2 has a CER of 0.1918604651 for the segment around 1465.47596875 to 1485.47596875.
        *   **Analysis:** The CERs are similar, but the ASR text is different, suggesting that the two versions are making different errors.

3.  **Text Alignment Issues:**

    *   **Version 1 (1504.193 - 1514.571671875):** "Die n\u00e4chste Frage stellt der Kollege Andreas Beck, AfD." aligns with "Die n\u00e4chste Frage stellt der Kollege Andreas Bleck, AfD." (CER 0.0181818182)
    *   **Version 2 (1504.66971875 - 1511.64284375):** "Die n\u00e4chste Frage stellt der Kollege Andreas Beck, AfD." aligns with "Die n\u00e4chste Frage stellt der Kollege Andreas Bleck, AfD." (CER 0.0181818182)
    *   **Version 2 (1511.64284375 - 1513.83659375):** "Ich muss hier k\u00fchner dran kommen, ne?" aligns with "haben auch einen angemessenen" (CER 0.6756756757)
        *   **Analysis:** Version 2 misaligns the audio, resulting in a high CER.

4.  **Speaker Change/Boundary Problems:**

    *   The segments around 1590s in Version 2 show very high CER values and short segment durations. This is a strong indicator that the alignment is failing to handle a speaker change or some other acoustic event correctly. The ASR seems to be picking up on something other than the intended speech.

**Potential Reasons for Performance Differences:**

*   **ASR Model:** The underlying ASR models used in the two versions are likely different. This can lead to variations in transcription accuracy, especially with challenging audio (noise, accents, etc.).
*   **Alignment Algorithm:** The alignment algorithms themselves could be different. One might be more robust to errors in the ASR output or better at handling speaker changes.
*   **VAD (Voice Activity Detection):** Differences in VAD algorithms can lead to different segment boundaries. A more aggressive VAD might cut off the beginnings or ends of utterances, leading to higher CER values.
*   **Parameter Tuning:** The alignment systems likely have various parameters that can be tuned. Different parameter settings could lead to different segmentation and alignment results.
*   **Data Used for Training:** The ASR models and alignment algorithms may have been trained on different datasets. This could affect their performance on specific types of audio.

**Systematic Patterns:**

*   Version 2 appears to be more prone to over-segmentation, especially around speaker changes or difficult acoustic conditions.
*   Version 1 tends to create longer segments, which can be beneficial if the ASR is reasonably accurate, but can also lead to higher CER values if the ASR makes significant errors within a long segment.
*   Version 2 seems to have more issues with the beginning of the audio, as the first segment starts later than Version 1.

**Conclusion:**

Version 1 and Version 2 show noticeable differences in segmentation and alignment quality. Version 2's tendency to over-segment, particularly around speaker changes, and its misalignment of audio segments, suggest that it may be less robust than Version 1 in this specific time frame. The differences in CER values and ASR text highlight the impact of the underlying ASR model and alignment algorithm on the overall performance. Further investigation, including analyzing more data and examining the system configurations, would be needed to pinpoint the exact causes of these differences.
